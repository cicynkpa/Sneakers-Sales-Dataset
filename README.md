 ### Conclusion and recommendation
 - Nigeria and Ghana should be the primary focus for products sales as there is more units sales in both countries compared to the others.
 - Both In-Store and Online sales method seems to have good sales peeformance, although In-Store has a little significant increase in sales compared to online sales, i recommend still focusing on both sales method.
 - I recommed selling more units of Adidas Gazelle in Egypt and Senagal as it is the top selling product in both countries.
